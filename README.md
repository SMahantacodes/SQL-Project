# capstone Project-SQL
This SQL Capstone Project showcases my ability to solve real-world business problems using the AirlineDB database. Through a variety of challenges, I demonstrated skills in structured data extraction, date formatting, and querying across multiple tables with joins, CTEs, and window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and DENSE_RANK(). The project involved analyzing flight operations, including identifying the longest and earliest flights, tracking cancellations and delays, and examining airport activity. I also focused on passenger insights by identifying the highest and lowest paying customers on a month-by-month basis and calculating refund amounts for cancelled flights. Additionally, the project included aircraft and seating analysis, such as evaluating seating distributions and studying aircraft models like Airbus and Boeing. Throughout the project, I used advanced SQL techniques including aggregation, subqueries, conditional filtering, and optimized performance queries to deliver meaningful and actionable insights from complex airline operational data.
